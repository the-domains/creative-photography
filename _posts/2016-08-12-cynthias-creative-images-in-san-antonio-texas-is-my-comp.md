  Cynthiaâ€™s Creative Images, in San Antonio, Texas, is my company that features
  the images of a fine art photographer that was trained at Lipscomb University
  in Nashville. I offer a wide array of options for those interested in portrait
  photography and themed sessions for the kids. My works have been featured in
  downtown bookstores and the airport, as well as discussed on radio and in
  newspaper features. My distinctive approach includes marketing products like
  logos and stationery, and I look forward to working with you.
